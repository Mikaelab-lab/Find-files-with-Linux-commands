# Find files with Linux commands

<h2>Activity Overview</h2>
In this lab activity, you’ll navigate a Linux file structure, locate files, and read the contents of files. You’ll also need to answer a few multiple-choice questions based on the information contained in these files.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

In this scenario, you have to locate and analyze the information of certain files located in the /home/analyst directory.

Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll get the information of the current working directory you’re in and display the contents of the directory. Second, you’ll navigate to the reports directory and list the subdirectories it contains. Third, you’ll navigate to the users subdirectory and display the contents of the Q1_added_users.txt file. Finally, you’ll navigate to the logs directory and display the first 10 lines of a file it contains.

<h2>Task 1. Get the current directory information</h2>

In this task, you must use the commands you learned about to check the current working directory and list its contents.
